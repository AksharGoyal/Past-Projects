# 6.0 Finish the Game session.

There really is nothing left to teach. The session this afternoon will be focused on fixing bugs and helping you guys finish the game.

I can also provide you guys with some guidance as to how you may implement additional features into the game. 

Example Additional Features:

- Scoring Sytem (Highscore and score multipliers)
- Snake wrap-around
- Input buttons
