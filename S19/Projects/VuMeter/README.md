# Hardware: VU - Meter

In this beginner friendly project we'll be learning how to use an Arduino to take in an analog input and produce a digital output. Our case study will be the vu-meter, or a volume unit meter. This device can measure the amount of energy a sound makes using a microphone, and then display it using a row of LEDs. We'll start learning from scratch and assume no prior knowledge programming or building circuits.

## Objective

* Take in input from a breakout mounted microphone
* Learn how to wire up LEDs and program them in a variety of ways
* Do some basic signal processing to smooth out the action of our vu-meter

## Tools and Technologies
