# CnC Data Science Lesson 3

Hi everyone! Here's an overview of the topics we will approach for this lesson
- Forest.js exploration
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Coding! And playing around with different models

Forest.js is an amazing open source library that visualizes a random forest algorithm extremely well. It is accessible via the forestjs folder in this repository. To see the html rendition, it is under demo/demoforest.html.
