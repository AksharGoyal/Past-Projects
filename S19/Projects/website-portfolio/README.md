## Welcome to the front-end web dev project for Spring 2019!

This semester, we will be creating website portfolios sites from scratch. The idea is that you can personalize this space on the web to reflect work and experiences in a more interactive manner than a physical resume. We will primarily be using React.js and SASS, and will also teach you how to deploy your website to the internet with Github Pages. 


The course will be broken up into seven lessons, which will be held from 6-8pm on Wednesdays in E7. Typically, the first hour will be teaching, and during the second you can apply what you have learned in to your projects while we are around to help! All lesson material will be posted on this github, so don't fear if you cannot make it to one of the classes.
