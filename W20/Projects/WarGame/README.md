# WarGame Competition
Our goal is to make bots that compete in a halo-inspired global war game using Python! You will be responsible for developing the strategy your bot will use to conquer the battlefield.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop an understanding of intermediate Python. This includes getting full use of the standard library, writing more pythonic code, learning about classes, and much more!

- Become confident in your ability to develop python programs

## Tools and Technologies

[Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) as the language of choice.

[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted/) as our optional visualizer.
