# Arduino Security System Hardware Project

Build, from scratch, a secure box powered by your very own Arduino security system.  No need to bring your own hardware as Coffee â€˜N Code will lend you kit.

## Objective
* Learn to read circuit schematics
* Design a complex electronic system
* Use general purpose input/output to control an Arduino

## Tools and Technologies
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* [Arduino Simulator for Web](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits)
**OR**
[Arduino Simulator for Windows](https://www.sites.google.com/site/unoardusim/services)
* [Arduino Code support](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples)
