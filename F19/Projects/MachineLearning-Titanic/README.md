# Predict Survival on Titanic
We will build an end to end machine learning pipeline to calculate the probability of survival on the titanic shipwreck. Our goal is to teach the basic tools and theory required to tackle any machine learning problem.

## Learning Objectives

  - Pickup practical experience in various critical stages of a machine learning pipeline - data visualization, data cleaning, feature engineering, feature selection, modelling, model evaluation
  - Uncover the blackbox that is machine learning by understanding the workings of popular machine learning algorithms. 

## Schedule 
| Week | Lesson |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Introduction to machine learning, Visualizing the training set|
| 2 | Perform Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection on the dataset |
| 3 | Predicting the survival rates under different algorithms |
| 4 | Ensemble/Tree algorithms , Hyperparameter tuning, Model Evaluation |
| 5 | Predicting the shipwreck survival of students! |
