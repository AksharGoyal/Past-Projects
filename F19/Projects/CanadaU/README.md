Hello and welcome to Coffee N Code!
<br>
My name is Michael, and I'll be guiding you through our project <i>CanadaU</i>.
<br>

### Join the [Coffee N Code Slack](https://bit.ly/uwcoffeencodeslack), then join the `#canada-u` channel for project updates.

## Project Overview

CanadaU is a website which gathers trends from Canadian university subreddits, and puts them all in one place.
<br>
The project is open-ended, so you can add your own ideas and functionality as you feel comfortable.

Technologies we'll be using:
- Python with the [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) framework
- JavaScript with the [React](https://reactjs.org) framework
- [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
