In today's lesson, we added a Camera to the CameraScreen, and we started to add TextInputs to a new InputScreen.

The list of files changed are:
*  `screens/InputScreen.tsx`
*  `navigation/AppContainer.tsx`
*  `screens/CameraScreen.tsx`
*  `package.json`

If you missed the last lesson, we made changes to the `screens/ResultsScreen.tsx` file, just to style it like a proper table.

Next week, we will be handling text recognition with react-native-text-detector: 
https://github.com/zsajjad/react-native-text-detector

and handling some loose ends so that we can finalize our project. Hope to see you there!
