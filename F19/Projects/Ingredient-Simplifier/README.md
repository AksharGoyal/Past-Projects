# Ingredient Simplifier App
Get started with some new tech, by building a cross-platform app with React Native! :raised_hands: This app will take a photo of the ingredients list on a food label, and translate all the complicated terms into simple synonyms. 

## Learning Objectives
- A lot of good hackathon projects or side projects require an app. Don't cower in fear of daunting platforms like Android Studio or XCode -- React Native lets you write simple code *once* and run it on *both* platforms (Android and iOS).

- Learn how to use React -- one of the newest and most ubiquitous technologies for web development (and now mobile + VR too!). We will be covering some basics of Javascript/Typescript along the way.

- Deploy and scale your app professionally with Firebase, an easy cloud system that's popular for building side projects.

## Tools and Technologies
- **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** as the main language for programming the web app.  
- **[Expo](http://expo.io/)** as the platform for cross-platform development. This is based on the **[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)** framework.  
- **[Firebase](http://firebase.com)** as a toolkit for databases, authentication, computer vision, and other backend logic.
